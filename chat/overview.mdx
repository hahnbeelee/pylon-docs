Embed in-app chat into your application so your customers can talk to you directly from the context of your product. Provide customer support, gather product feedback, or surface important links straight from the chat window.

## Use Cases

For each of these use cases, you can leverage many of the workflows and settings you've already set in the rest of Pylon to provide a consistent experience for you and your Customer.

<CardGroup cols={1}>
  <Card title="Chat Conversations" icon="message-captions" color="#ea5a0c">
    Chat directly with your customer to provide support and gather product
    feedback right from your app. Leverage the Kanban board to seamlessly track and handle longer running chat
    conversations from your existing workflow.

  </Card>
  <Card title="Broadcasts" icon="megaphone" color="#16a34a">
    Push product updates directly in the app where and when it's most relevant to your customer. Deliver the same broadcast across your Slack channels and your app to provide multiple touchpoints for the same product update.

  </Card>
  <Card title="Links" icon="link" color="#0285c7">
    Showcase helpful links like documentation, status pages, and community
    links, straight from the chat window. Reuse the channel bookmarks you've already set in your customer channels.

## Slack-like Collaboration

This is much more collaborative than an ordinary 1:1 chat support. Messages will sync to your shared customer channel where the rest of your team and your customer's team can respond to the question.

If only admin users are in the shared channel and no end users, syncing chat conversations to the channel will give your admin users visibility into what their team is asking and allow them to answer questions directly, essentially promoting your champion to support.

For customers without a shared channel i.e. self-serve customers, sync messages to a support channel where your team can collaborate and respond directly from Slack. No need to hop into another product to quickly answer the question.
