We expose some functions in the Frontend to programmtically control the Chat window.

## window.Pylon("show")

Opens the chat window. Useful for programmatically triggering the chat window from an explicit support flow or button on your site.

## window.Pylon("hide")

Closes the chat window.

## window.Pylon("onChangeUnreadMessagesCount")

Pass in a callback function that is called when the unread message count changes. If you pass in a null callback function, the existing callback is removed.
```
Intercom("onChangeUnreadMessagesCount", function(unreadCount) {
  console.log("unread changed!", unreadCount)
});
```
