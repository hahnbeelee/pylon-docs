## Creating a Community Channel

<Steps>
  <Step title="Creating a Community Channel">
Go to the channel you'd like to link and add Pylon to the channel with `/invite @Pylon`. You'll get a prompt to enable Pylon. Select `Community Channel`.
  </Step>

<Step title="Configure Thread Behavior">
    Head over to app.usepylon.com/workflows/support-issue and turn on Ticketing. This allows us to turn every message into a support ticket.

    We recommend turning off "Closed Ticket Message" and turning on "CSAT" but feel free to fiddle with the settings so it's just how you like it!

</Step>

<Step title="Testing">
  Now head over to the community channel and send a question. You should see
  this pop up in your kanban as well as a new community tab on the Analytics
  Page.
</Step>

<Step title="All Done!">
