Scalably support your Slack community bug and help channels by turning customer questions into Pylon issues. Funnel these questions into the rest of your support workflows and leverage your triage channel and kanban board to answer all support questions in one place.

## Use Cases

Communities always have a help or getting-started channel where every message is a new question from a different user. You may even have many of these channels, separated by topic or experience levels.

  <Card title="Unificiation" icon="handshake" color="#ea5a0c">
    Unify this support source with the rest of your support workflows in your
    triage channels and kanban so you can answer your customers from one place.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Autocollect Info" icon="robot" color="#16a34a">
    Automatically ask for more information so by the time you get there, your
    customer has already added the debug info you need.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Analytics" icon="chart-simple" color="#0285c7">
    Get per account analytics on who is asking for support in your community.
    Filter down the more important customers in your community and understand
    how you're supporting them.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Behavior

Before you try it out, here's some things you should know...

- Every message in the channel will turn into an issue.
- Every issue must have a threaded message under it (we'll configure this on the next page). This is intentionally meant to help your customers start threads and keep your channels tidy.
- After you're done with the issue, we will react âœ… emoji onto the thread so it's clear to your customers where the queue stands.
