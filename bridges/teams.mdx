The Slack-Teams Bridge allows you to mirror messages from a Teams Channel to a
Slack channel in your own workspace, and vice versa. This feature reduces the
pain of having to use Teams to talk to customers that don't use Slack
internally.

Threaded and non-threaded conversations are supported.

## Limitations

### DMs

We do not currently track DMs that you may be sent through Teams.

### Channel Setup

Group chats and channels are supported, but only if you created them. Otherwise,
your customer is the only one that can add Pylon into the channel or chat.

If you already have a chat that the customer created, you must move the
conversation to a chat or channel that you've initiated.

### Files

Files and attachments are currently not supported.
