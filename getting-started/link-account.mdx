## Creating Triage Channels

<Tip>
  We recommend reading the guides on [Conversational Ticketing](/ticketing) &
  [Triage Channels](/ticketing/triage-channel) first
</Tip>

### For Small Teams

Make one channel called _#customer-alerts_. We recommend keeping this public.

### For Larger Teams

If you have multiple team members handling accounts, we recommend opening up one
triage channel per person on your team is responsible for handling account
messages.

For example, if you have three CSMs Alex, Sabrina, and John:

- _#alex-customers_
- _#sabrina-customers_
- _#john-customers_

<Check>You can now connect customer channels to these Triage Channels.</Check>

## Enable a Customer Channel

<Tip>
  During onboarding, our implementation team can help you bulk enable Pylon in
  your existing channels. Ask them about bulk enabling in the shared Slack
  channel.
</Tip>

Pylon will only be enabled in customer channels that you explicitly enable it
in. If you want it to be enabled in channels automatically, you can use our
[CRM widget](/crm/salesforce/features#channel-creation-from-salesforce) to
create channels and setup Pylon for you.

1. Go to your customer channel
2. Type `/invite @Pylon` or the whatever you named the Pylon bot as and click
   enter.

     <img src="/images/enable-1.png" />
   </Frame>

3. You'll get a prompt to enable Pylon in the channel

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/enable-3.png" />
</Frame>

5. Fill out the modal with your preferences including selecting the desired
   triage channel (these will be saved for the next time)

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/enable-4.png" />
</Frame>

<Check>
  This channel has now been enabled and now messages from the customer in that
  channel will be sent to the triage channel!
