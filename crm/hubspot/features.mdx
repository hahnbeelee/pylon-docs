## Activity Sync

Everyday, Pylon scans your customer channels for conversations that were had.
For every conversation, we use AI to summarize the details, and sync the summary
to the relevant `Account` in Hubspot.

## Contact Sync

When someone new joins a prospect or customer channel, we add that contact to
Hubspot and link it to the relevant `Account`.

## Account Cards 

See Pylon account cards directly on Hubspot accounts. View information from Pylon like which Slack channel
is connected to this account and a direct link to it.

## Channel Creation from Hubspot

You can greatly simplify Slack channel creation using our Hubspot widget.
Fill out the desired channel name on the deal page and click `Create Channel` from the sidebar of the deal page and the
following will automatically happen:

1. Channel will be created and named
2. The deal owner and all contacts tied to the deal will be sent an invite to join the channel
3. Pylon will be enabled within the channel
