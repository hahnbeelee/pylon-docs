## Activity Sync

Everyday, Pylon scans your customer channels for conversations that were had.
For every conversation, we use AI to summarize the details, and sync the summary
to the relevant `Account` in Hubspot.

## Contact Sync

When someone new joins a prospect or customer channel, we add that contact to
Hubspot and link it to the relevant `Account`.

## Channel Creation from Hubspot


<Note>
Reach out to the Pylon team for help configuring Hubspot Channel Creation. This requires creating a custom property on the Deal or Company object and adding it to your layout.
</Note>

You can greatly simplify Slack channel creation using our Hubspot widget.
Fill out the desired channel name on the deal or company page and click `Create Channel` from the sidebar the
following will automatically happen:

1. Channel will be created and named
2. You will be invited to the channel
2. All contacts tied to the deal/company will be sent an invite to join the channel
3. Pylon will be enabled within the channel
