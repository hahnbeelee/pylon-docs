## Activity Sync

Everyday, Pylon scans your customer channels for conversations that were had.
For every conversation, we use AI to summarize the details, and sync the summary
to the relevant `Company` in Attio.

## Contact Sync

When someone new joins a prospect or customer channel, we add that contact to
Attio and link it to the relevant `Account`.
