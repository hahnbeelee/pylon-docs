## Support Hours

You can set custom support hours so that if a customer opens a support ticket
outside of those hours, a custom message will be posted.

### Escalation

<Tip>
  We recommend you setup escalation not by using this method, but by collecting
  a severity on ticket open, and triggering escalation from your support system
  based on the selection.
</Tip>

If a message is sent outside of support hours you can enable an `Escalate`
button to be included with the message. If the button is clicked, a message will
be sent to a pre-selected escalation channel.
