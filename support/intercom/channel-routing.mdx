The Intercom Routing feature allows you to take an issue created by Pylon in one
Slack channel and route it through Intercom to another different Slack channel.
The origination channel, destination channel, Intercom, and an optional internal
feed channel will all be kept in syncing, allowing all parties to communicate
with each other.

<Warning>
  Note: The origination and destination slack channels must be linked Pylon
  accounts. You can see which accounts are linked on the [Accounts
  Page](https://app.usepylon.com/accounts).
</Warning>

To route an issue from Slack to another Slack channel you can either use a saved
macro, or fill in the slack channel ID in your custom attribute, and then
execute a custom action. If the issue successfully routed, you will see a note
in Intercom indicating this.

### Setup with Macros

If this is a common channel you route issues to, you can
[create a macro](https://www.notion.so/Intercom-Routing-a06f06328385471e8296d4b059e8c8b7?pvs=21)
