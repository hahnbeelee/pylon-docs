## Additional Configuration

### Removing Email Notifications For Slack Tickets

Zendesk is typically configured to send email notifications to the customer when
there are new replies, or different events occur. Because tickets are being
created from and will be updated in Slack, we don’t want to send additional
email notifications for these tickets.

1. Go to the Admin Center and click `Objects and rules` > `Triggers` (under
   Business rules)
2. For each trigger that starts with `Notify requester ...` modify the trigger

   1. In the `Conditions` section add the following to the
      **`Meet ALL of the following` section**
   2. Typically the relevant trigger rules that need to be updated are called
      **`Notify requester and CCs of received request`,
      `Notify requester of new proactive ticket`,
      `Notify requester and CCs of comment update`** {" "}

      </Frame>

3. Repeat the above also for any custom triggers you have that send emails to
   the customer

### Required Fields

If you have required fields setup before a ticket closes, Pylon cannot close out
tickets from Slack because it does not know what values to set for those
required fields. There are a couple of options - please let the Pylon team know
which option you’d like so we can configure it for you.

#### Option 1: New “Pending” status called “Closed in Slack”

Create a new status `Closed in Slack` that is under the `Pending` category. When
a customer closes out an issue from Slack, the ticket will be moved to this
status along with a note on the ticket. Your team can setup a new view or use a
workflow to then input required fields before “officially” closing out these
issues. Customers see no difference in behavior after they have marked the issue
as closed in Slack.

1. To do this, go to the Admin Center and click on `Objects and rules` >
   `Ticket statuses` (under Tickets)
2. Click `Create ticket status` and create a new status called `Closed in Slack`
   under the `Pending` category

   <Frame>
     <img src="/images/zd-setup-2.png" />
   </Frame>

3. Once you have made the new status, let the Pylon team know and we will apply
   this change.

#### Option 2: Don’t allow customers to close out ticket in Slack

Don’t allow customers to close out issues in Slack. This means only your team
can close out tickets in Zendesk, and input required fields when doing so.

If you choose this option, let the Pylon team know and they will disable the
setting that allows customers to close out tickets from Slack.
