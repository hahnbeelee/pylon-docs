## After Hours Message

When you have custom Support Hours, you can post a custom message when a customer creates a ticket.

Enable this feature on the [Workflows Page](https://app.usepylon.com/workflows) in the Support Hours tab.

## Escalation

If a message is sent outside of support hours you can enable an `Escalate`
button to be included with the message. If the button is clicked, a message will
be sent to a pre-selected escalation channel.
