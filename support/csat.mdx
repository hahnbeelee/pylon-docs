## Benefits

- CSAT response rates over Slack are orders of magnitude better than email.
- Get an overview of feedback from customers in the analytics dashboard.
- Drill down into specific issues to diagnose a bad CSAT score.

## How it works

- You must have ticketing on to opt into this workflow.
- The CSAT survey is sent to the customer who opened the issue.

## Setup

- Head over to the Support Issue tab on the Workflows Page, CSAT is the toggle at the very bottom. After you toggle it, you should be good to go!
- Feel free to also take a look at the CSAT tab on the Analytics Page.
