## Set a Title

The title will not be sent to the channels, it's only for you to sort through

## Write your Message

Slack message etiquette is very different from other mediums like Email. When
writing your Broadcast, follow the following tips:

1. Keep it Short
2. Use Emojis
3. Attach an Image or Link

<Tip>See some pre-written messages on our [Examples Page](/examples).</Tip>

Type your message into the text editor on the left, and see a preview of the
message on the right. We currently support the following message content types:

  Emojis can be added either as raw emojis like üéâ or raw string form like
  `:tada:`. Custom emojis are supported via the latter method like
  `:custom_emoji:`.

### Show or Hide Link Preview

When you send links on Slack, a link preview image is typically shown below your
messsage. You can manually enable or disable this preview after adding a link to
the message.

<Frame caption="The Link Preview is everything to the right of the grey bar under main message">

## Choose Sender

You can choose to send the broadcast either as yourself or the company.

<Frame>

</Frame>

## Select your Audience

A preview of what Slack channels your Broadcast will be sent to is always
visible on the right under the Message Preview. There are two top-level filters
you can use to choose who to send a broadcast to based on:

1. Account Ownership
2. Channel Tags

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/create-broadcast-audience.png" />
</Frame>

### Account Ownership

The first audience filter is choosing to send to `All Accounts` vs
`Your Accounts`. You own an account if you are the `Account Owner`. You can see
and edit this information on the
[Accounts Page](https://app.usepylon.com/accounts).

### Channel Tags

You can choose to send a Broadcast to only channels that have a certain tag.
Tags can either be set in Pylon on the
[Accounts Page](https://app.usepylon.com/accounts) or come from your CRM.
[Connect your CRM](#).

### Deselect a Channel

There may be instances where you want to send to all channels that have a tag,
except for some. To achieve this, first filter by the channel tag, then click on
the channel on the right under the preview message.

## Engagement Notifications

After sending your Broadcast, Pylon will live track all engagements on your
messages across all channels including link clicks, reactions, and replies.
These can be viewed in Pylon, or made easily visible in Slack for others to see
as well.

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/create-broadcast-engagement.png" />
</Frame>

You can select to have a feed of engagement notifications to be sent to you or
to a public channel for others to see as well.

## Sending the Broadcast

<Warning>
  Always send a preview before sending a Broadcast to ensure the message sends
  with correct formatting. Broadcasts cannot be unsent.
</Warning>

### Send a Preview

Once your message is ready to be sent, send a preview by clicking the
`Send Preview` Button at the bottom of the modal, to the left of the
`Send Button`. You'll be able to select whether to send the preview to yourself
or to a channel.

<Frame>

### Final Send

If your preview looks good, click the `Send` button next to the `Send Preview`
bottom. You'll get a confirmation before the Broadcast gets sent.
