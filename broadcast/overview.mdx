## What is a Broadcast?

A Broadcast is a message that you can send to many Slack channels at once. After
sending, Pylon will track all engagements including reactions, replies, and link
clicks across all the channels the Broadcast was sent to.

<Tip>
  If you find yourself copy-pasting the same message over and over into many
  channels at a time, you should probably be sending a Broadcast instead.

## Broadcasts vs Email

The difference between sending a message in Slack vs Email is that Slack is
where your customers talk with their own team. As a result, all messages sent
over Slack get seen.

This power comes with great responsibility. So make sure your messages are
relevant to your Broadcast recipients.
