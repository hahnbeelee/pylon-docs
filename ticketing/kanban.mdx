<Tip>
  Use the [Triage Channel](triage-channel) for daily tracking and the Kanban
  board for getting a bird's eye view.
</Tip>

The [Kanban Board](https://app.usepylon.com/issues) allows you to track all
conversations across all customer channels at once. It's great for getting
visibility into your own customer issues for messages you may have forgotten
about.
