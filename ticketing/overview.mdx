<Tip>
  If you find yourself losing track of customer messages, not responding
  quickly, or needing analytics on your customer conversations, it's time to
  start using Pylon's ticketing.
</Tip>

Pylon's ticketing system gives GTM teams structure around their customer
conversations.

All customer messages are captured and grouped into units of `Conversation`. For
example, if two messages come in from a customer about the same topic, we
automatically group them together.

Each conversation has a status of `Open`, `In Progress`, or `Closed`.

Conversations can be viewed and handled directly in Slack via
[Triage Channels](triage-channel) or from the [Kanban Board](kanban).

Account Executives and Customer Success Managers typically have their own
`Triage Channels` where they can track conversations related only to their own
`Accounts`.

Conversational tickets are completely invisible to a customer, unless you
explicitly connect a conversation to a support tool like `Zendesk`, `Intercom`,
or `Salesforce Service`.

Conversations are created out of all customer Slack messages, including use
cases like:

<CardGroup cols={1}>
  <Card title="Support Questions" icon="bug" color="#ea5a0c">
    Either traige support questions directly or deflect them to a Support Team
    like Zendesk, while still allowing the customer to stay in Slack and for you
    to retain visibility.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Relationship Building" icon="handshake" color="#0285c7">
    Make sure you have good visibility on your customer asks, and always know
    what you need to respond to.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Sales Conversations" icon="money-bills" color="#16a34a">
    Sales conversations are time-sensitive. Leverage our SLA monitoring to make
    sure you respond promptly.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Product Feedback" icon="comments" color="#dc2626">
    Engage the rest of your team on feedback from prospects or customers.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## New Conversations

A new conversation is created when a customer sends a message into any of your
customer channels. At that moment we initiate a `Conversational Ticket` or add
the message to an existing one.

The conversation is visible in both your `Triage Channel` and the
[Kanban Board](https://app.usepylon.com/issues).

Messages will be grouped into a conversation using a combination of criteria
including AI, threading, timing.

## Conversation Owners

Conversations are assigned an `Owner` based on who the `Channel Owner` is for
the `Account`. The `Channel Owner` is set when Pylon is added to that channel.

You can always modify it by:

1. Going to the [Accounts Page](https://app.usepylon.com/accounts)
2. Clicking on the relevant `Account`
3. Choosing a new `Account Owner`

## Conversation Status

New conversations start with the status `To Do`. As you respond to customer
messages, Pylon uses AI to categorize the status of the conversation for you or
you can always update the status manually using the
[Kanban Board](https://app.usepylon.com/issues).

| Status        | Explanation                                                  | Sample Trigger                                          |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `To Do`       | You have not responded to the message.                       | Customer sends any message.                             |
| `In Progress` | You sent a response that does not conclude the conversation. | You say "Taking a look" or "Let me check with the team" |
| `Closed`      | You sent a response that concluded the conversation.         | You say "I just confirmed with the team..."             |

<Frame caption="This response will mark the conversation as `In Progress`">
  <img src="/images/non-conclusive.png" />
</Frame>

<Frame caption="This response will mark the conversation as `Closed`">
  <img src="/images/conclusive.png" />
</Frame>

## Closing a Ticket

You can mark a conversation as `Closed` in the Triage Channel by clicking the
`Acknowledge` button in the Triage Channel, responding to a customer with a
conclusive message, or by manually dragging a Conversation into the `Closed`
state.

## Discussing Issues Internally

Because Traige Channels are just Slack channels, you can have discussions with
others about Conversations directly from there. Simply add a reply within the
Triage Channel.
