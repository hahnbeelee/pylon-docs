## Default Tags

Pylon supports AI-Tagging of Conversations that are about the following topics:

- `Bugs`
- `Meetings Scheduled`
- `Product Feedback`
- `User Errors`
- `Customer Love`

<Tip>Multiple Tags can be applied to a single Conversation</Tip>

## Custom Tags

You can ask the Pylon team to include a custom topic to use AI tagging with.

Some examples, we, as the Pylon team use internally include:

- Pylon Integrations (`Salesforce`, `Zendesk`, etc)
- Product Surface Areas (`Kanban`, `Feed`, `Broadcast`, `Docs`, etc)

## Usage

You can filter AI Tags on the
[Kanban Board](https://app.usepylon.com/conversations) and see them on the
Conversation sidebar.
