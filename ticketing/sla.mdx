<Tip>Tip: You can set SLAs based on data in your CRM</Tip>

SLAs (AKA Service Level Agreements) are reminder-based rules for how quickly you
want to respond and resolve customer issues.

Pylon supports two levels of SLA:

1. First Response Time: First response time is how quickly someone on your team
   has responded to a message or request.

2. Resolution Time: Time to resolution is how long it takes to close a
   conversation after it's been started.

## Setup

You can customize SLAs on the
[Workflows Page](https://app.usepylon.com/workflows).

SLAs can be customized for different sets of customers based on Tags set either
in Pylon or tags set from your CRM.

For example, below we have seperated pre-sales and post-sales SLAs:

| SLA                        | First Response | Resolution | Escalation Channel   |
| -------------------------- | -------------- | ---------- | -------------------- |
| Default                    | 60m            | 7 days     | #support-escalations |
| Prospect (Pulled from CRM) | 60m            | 2 days     | #prospect-alerts     |

## SLA Alerts

If the SLA period is passed, the following alerts will sent out.

1. The `Escalation Channel` configured will be notified
2. If the `Conversation` has an Assignee they will aslo get a direct message
   from the Pylon bot

## Support Hours

If you want the SLAs times to only work during your working hours, you can
configure Support Hours on the
[Workflows Page](https://app.usepylon.com/workflows).

This ends up being useful for off-hours on weekdays and weekends.
