<Tip>
  You can capture support ticket analytics through your support system. Leverage
  conversational ticketing analytics for everything else.
</Tip>

Conversation ticket analytics aims fill the gap for all the data you don't have
about your customer conversations.

Because Pylon is able to turn every conversation into a `Conversational Ticket`,
we have never before captured data similar to what a support team has had for
ages.
