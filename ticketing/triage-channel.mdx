<Tip>
  Use the Triage Channel for daily tracking and the [Kanban Board](kanban) for
  getting a bird's eye view.
</Tip>

Triage Channel functions as an in-Slack Todo list for you, or a small team, to
stay on top of customer messages.

All conversations are posted into the channel and when conversations stay up to
date with the correct status and latest message preview.

Company logos of your prospect and customer accounts are used to make the feed
more visually appealing and readable.

## Status

Conversation `Status` is indicated by the colored bar on the left of the
message.

| Color     | Explanation                              |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| üü® Yellow | The conversation status is `To Do`       |
| üü¶ Blue   | The conversation status is `In Progress` |
| ‚òëÔ∏è Gray   | You conversation status is `Closed`      |

## Marking as Closed

Conversations will automatically close when you respond to conversation with a
message that concludes the conversation. Alternatively, you can mark the
conversation as closed by clicking the `Acknowledge` button.

Once closed, the conversation will collapse and show the purple `Closed` status.

## Discussing Issues Internally

Because Traige Channels are just Slack channels, you can have discussions with
others about Conversations directly from there. Simply add a reply within the
Triage Channel.

## Best Practices

### For Small Teams

Small teams should open up a single Triage Channel called `#customer-alerts`.

### For Larger Teams

If you have multiple team members handling accounts, you can segment further. We
recommend opening up one triage channel per person on your team is responsible
for handling account messages.

For example, if you have three Account Managers Alex, Sabrina, and John:

- _#alex-customers_
- _#sabrina-customers_
- _#john-customers_
